This `Math` class is a simple utility with basic arithmetic methods to add, subtract, multiply, and divide two integers. Each method is `public` and `static`, meaning they can be accessed without needing to create an instance of the `Math` class.

### 1. `add` Method

**Description:**  
This method is used to add two integers together. It takes two integers as input, adds them, and returns the result.

```java
public static int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

**Parameters:**
- `int a`: The first integer to add.
- `int b`: The second integer to add.

**Return Value:**
- The method returns an integer, which is the sum of `a` and `b`.

**Example:**
```java
int result = Math.add(3, 4); // result will be 7
```

**Explanation:**  
This method takes the values of `a` and `b`, adds them using the `+` operator, and returns the sum.

---

### 2. `subtract` Method

**Description:**  
This method subtracts one integer from another. It takes two integers as input, subtracts the second integer (`b`) from the first integer (`a`), and returns the result.

```java
public static int subtract(int a, int b) {
    return a - b;
}
```

**Parameters:**
- `int a`: The integer to subtract from (the starting number).
- `int b`: The integer to subtract (the amount to be removed from `a`).

**Return Value:**
- The method returns an integer, which is the result of `a - b`.

**Example:**
```java
int result = Math.subtract(10, 3); // result will be 7
```

**Explanation:**  
Here, `a` and `b` are subtracted using the `-` operator, and the difference is returned.

---

### 3. `multiply` Method

**Description:**  
This method multiplies two integers. It takes two integers as input, multiplies them, and returns the product.

```java
public static int multiply(int a, int b) {
    return a * b;
}
```

**Parameters:**
- `int a`: The first integer to multiply.
- `int b`: The second integer to multiply.

**Return Value:**
- The method returns an integer, which is the product of `a` and `b`.

**Example:**
```java
int result = Math.multiply(3, 4); // result will be 12
```

**Explanation:**  
The method takes the integers `a` and `b`, multiplies them using the `*` operator, and returns the product.

---

### 4. `divide` Method

**Description:**  
This method divides one integer by another. It takes two integers as input, divides the first integer (`a`) by the second integer (`b`), and returns the result. It also includes error handling to prevent dividing by zero, which is not allowed in mathematics.

```java
public static int divide(int a, int b) {
    if (b == 0) {
        throw new ArithmeticException("Division by zero is not allowed.");
    }
    return a / b;
}
```

**Parameters:**
- `int a`: The integer to divide (the number to be divided).
- `int b`: The integer to divide by (the divisor).

**Return Value:**
- The method returns an integer, which is the result of `a / b`.

**Special Condition:**
- If `b` is zero, an `ArithmeticException` is thrown with the message "Division by zero is not allowed." This check is necessary because dividing by zero is undefined in mathematics and would cause a runtime error in Java.

**Example:**
```java
int result = Math.divide(10, 2); // result will be 5
// int errorResult = Math.divide(10, 0); // This will throw an exception
```

**Explanation:**  
The method uses the `/` operator to divide `a` by `b` and returns the result. However, before dividing, it checks if `b` is zero to avoid a crash.

**Summary of the `Math` Class:**

Each method is a straightforward example of basic arithmetic:
- `add` - Adds two integers.
- `subtract` - Subtracts one integer from another.
- `multiply` - Multiplies two integers.
- `divide` - Divides one integer by another, with a check to prevent division by zero.

These methods are simple to use and cover basic operations that are often needed in programs involving numbers.
